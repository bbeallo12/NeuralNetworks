# NeuralNetworks

I uploaded four of my old projects

	1) "Queen Chess Board"
		- My first attempt at the genetic algorithm to solve the queens chess problem
	2) "Neural Network Again"
		- The neural network I made and turned in for my ECE 304 assignment
	3) "NeuralNet_BallTraining"
		- I made this while I was working on the previous project to experiment with
		- different methods of backpropagation.  I emulated a ball rolling around a terrain
		- to find the lowest point.
	4) "Complex Neural Network"
		- My most recent project.
		- A neural network with complex values.
