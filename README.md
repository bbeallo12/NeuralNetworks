# NeuralNetworks

I uploaded five of my old projects

	1) "Queen Chess Board"
		- My first attempt at the genetic algorithm to solve the queens chess problem
	2) "Neural Network Again"
		- The neural network I made and turned in for my ECE 304 assignment
		- This time I used matrices
	3) "NeuralNet_BallTraining"
		- I made this while I was working on the previous project to experiment with
		- different methods of backpropagation.  I emulated a ball rolling around a terrain
		- to find the lowest point.
	4) "Complex Neural Network"
		- My most recent project.
		- This was my first attempt so it's rough around the edges and not very efficient
		- A neural network with complex values.
	5) "ComplexNeuralNetwork.m"
		- This will probably be the easiest code to follow since matlab is simple to read
		- I also named all of the weights, bias, and values independently so you can see the relationships between each value
		- so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOOKING AT THIS ONE because it will help with your basic understanding of neural networks in general
		- as well as with complex neural networks
		- I did my own R&D to figure out how to do the complex neural network more efficiently with matrices
		- This is my MATLAB code for my results
		- It trains quickly
